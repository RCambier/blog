            "content": "Hypothesis testing . import scipy as sp import numpy as np . A typical statement . A particular brand of tires claims that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced. From past studies of this tire, the standard deviation is known to be 8,000. A survey of owners of that tire design is conducted. From the 28 tires surveyed, the mean lifespan was 46,500 miles with a standard deviation of 9,800 miles. Using 𝛼=0.05 , is the data highly inconsistent with the claim? . claim_pop_mean = 50_000 pop_std = 8000 # What we know of the sample n = 28 sample_mean = 46_500 sample_std = 9800 # The chances of Type 1 error we are ready to accept alpha = 0.05 . The question can be formulated as: . &quot;Compared to the mean of that population (50_000), how crazy is the sample mean (46_500) ? With an alpha of 0.05&quot; | . which becomes . &quot;Using the sample deviation of the mean of that population, how far is the sample mean ? With an alpha of 0.05&quot; | . which becomes . &quot;Is the sample mean further away than 1.64 times the standard error of that population ?&quot; | . # H0 =&gt; pop_mean &gt;= 50_000 # H1 =&gt; pop_mean &lt; 50_000 population_standard_error = 8000 / np.sqrt(28) # &quot;If you grab a random sample mean, how is it going to variate&quot; how_far_we_are_from_pop_mean = (46_500 - 50_000) / population_standard_error # How far is this specific sample mean from the population mean. . There are different ways to reject the null hypothesis. . We can look at wether we are smaller or not than 0.05. . how_far_we_are_in_z = sp.stats.norm.cdf(how_far_we_are_from_pop_mean) how_far_we_are_in_z . 0.010305579572800304 . In this case we are at 0.01, which means that in the distribution of sample means, we are so extreme that there is no way that the sample mean we observed actually came from the sample mean distribution that we built looking at the population. . Another way is to look at how far we go on the axis, not in term of percentage (like 0,05 being 5%) but in term of distance from the population mean. This would look like the following . how_far_we_are_from_pop_mean . -2.315032397181517 . To know if this is a value too extreme or not, we can compare it to how far 0.05 is on the same axis: . - sp.stats.norm.ppf(0.95) . -1.6448536269514722 . When you don&#39;t have the population standard deviation . Realistically however, you often don&#39;t have the population standard deviation. In this case, you need to estimate it from the sample. . Doing that is less accurate. In order to compensate a bit, we need to model the &quot;spread of sample means&quot; a bit differently. . Since normally we allow the sample mean to only go &quot;so far&quot; from the population mean. We will force it to be &quot;even a bit further&quot;. The way we do this is by using a &quot;heavy tail&quot; distribution for the sample mean.

            "content": "Imagine a 747 is sitting on a conveyor belt, as wide and long as a runway. The conveyor belt is designed to [try to ?] exactly match the speed of the wheels, moving in the opposite direction. Can the plane take off? (different answers if you consider the words between brackets or not) . Hover to show the answer. . Yes. (Please don’t hit me). . If by speed of the wheels, we consider the speed of the the center of the wheels relative to the ground, then the answer is yes. The plane doesn’t use its wheel to take off. The motor thrust don’t care that the wheels are spinning or sliding or doing nothing. You have to realize that this is not like a car, the force is no pushing at the wheels, the force making the plane go forward is pushing where the motors are attached. So the wheels are just going to spin faster, and if the conveyor belt is long enough, the plane will take off. . Another way to see it is that the wheels are just there to keep the plane above the ground. They can spin at the speed they want, if the plane can move forward, it will take off. . Now, if by speed of the wheels, we consider the angular speed of the wheels then it gets complicated. This would basically be like saying “the conveyor belt does everything possible to make the plane not move”. . At that point, if the plane moves forward, the problem becomes mathematically impossible. When the plane is not moving, the angular speed is 0. When the plane moves, the angular speed is, let’s say, 10 ms/s. Now if the conveyor belt matches that speed, it will spin at 10m/s. But since the plane is still moving forward, this will make the wheels go at 20m/s (We consider here that the friction of the wheels is 0, they don’t affect the plane). So now the conveyor belt will have to match that speed. If the conveyor belt just tries to match the angular speed of the wheels, it will just go faster and faster up to infinity. If the friction of the wheels is 0, you could still argue in that situation that the plane will take off, with the wheel spinning infinitely fast in the opposite direction. . If the friction of the wheels is bigger than 0, you could argue that the threadmill manages to stop the plane. . If instead of the treadmill “trying to match” you have the treadmill “exactly matching” the speed of the wheels, than this becomes impossible. As soon as the plane starts going forward, this becomes an impossible situation because the treadmill has to match a speed that grows as it would try to match it. . Note that it doesn’t mean that the plane does not take off, but that the problem is mathematically impossible. . You can have a look at the excellent explanation from Randall Monroe on this problem here .",

I’m assuming that the week starts on Monday and ends on Friday. . So this is what the students think: . Okay, it can’t be on Friday, because if Friday comes and we haven’t had the test yet, then in the morning we’ll surely know it’s that day. So it will be a day from Monday to Thursday. After pondering a bit, they realise that it can’t be Thursday either, for the same reason: If Thursday comes and they haven’t had the exam they’ll think “we know it’s not Friday, therefore it has to be today”.

They are given one chance to be set free. Alice and Bob are placed in cells that have a view of a courtyard with trees. There are 20 trees in all, of which Alice sees 12 and Bob sees 8. Neither prisoner knows how many trees the other sees. But each prisoner is told the trees are partitioned between them: together they see all the trees, but individually no tree is seen by both of them. . . They have to figure out the total number of trees, but they are not allowed to communicate with each other. Each day the logician visits Alice in her cell and asks, “Are there 18 or 20 trees in total?” Alice has two choices: she can guess or pass. If Alice passes, then the logician visits Bob in his cell and asks the same question. Bob also can guess or pass. If Bob passes, then the logician retires for the night asks and repeats asking the questions the next day. Both prisoners know the procedure of how the logician is asking questions. There are consequences to guessing. If either person guesses incorrectly, then they are both trapped forever. If either person guesses correctly, however, then they are both set free immediately. Obviously they could guess and have a 50% chance. But can they do better? Is there a way they can escape with certainty? . Hover to show the answer. . This is a complex one. Answer is coming. .",

            "content": "At a party last night, my friends Alice and Bob did a magic trick. Any ideas how it worked? . Alice shuffled a pack of cards, and asked me to take five. I looked at them. She put the rest of the pack down on the table. Alice asked for my cards. She had a look at them. She gave four of them to Bob (he was across the table), and the fifth back to me. Bob looked at the four cards for a while. Then Bob looked at me, and named the card I was holding. He was right. I’m quite sure he couldn’t have seen it (we weren’t sitting by a mirror). . They did the trick again later to someone else. I watched for funny business. Alice didn’t say anything to Bob, so I don’t think they have a code. Also Alice is famously clumsy, so I doubt it was sleight of hand. . . Hover to show the answer. . When Alice had the five cards in hands, she needs to find a way to select one, and communicate which one she selected to Bob by showing Bob the four other cards. . Here is the way to do that: . In the five cards, there are always two of the same suite. | Alice is going to chose one of those two and tell which one to Bob using the 3 remaining cards. | The thing to notice is: when having two cards of the same suite, they are alway 6 cards appart in some direction. For example 7-heart and 9-heart are 2 apart. But queen-spade and 2-spade are 3 apart: queen-king-ace-2. | Now since there are 12 different cards per suite, two cards are always going to be maximum 6 steps away from each other. | So the way to do it is: from the two cards of the same suite, pick the one that allows reaching the other by adding up to 6 steps. So with 7-heart and 9-heart, pick 7-heart. With 2-spade and queen-spade, pick queen-spade. | Let’s continue in the case where Alice picked the queen-spade. | Alice gives back to Bob 3 cards + the queen-spade on top. And Bob has to guess 2-spade. | The goal is now to make the number ‘3’ with the 3 remaining random cards. That way Bob knows he has to add ‘3’ to the queen-spade, which will give him the 2-spade. | This is easily doable. With 3 cards you can make 6 combinations. Just assign each of them to a number. | Here is a way to do this: The 3 cards can always be ordered by value. So you can have card-1, card-2 and card-3. The six orders could be: [1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 3-1-2, 3-2-1]. Here we would select the order ‘2-1-3’ to represent the number 3. | So Bob sees the queen-spade, and then 3 cards that represent the number ‘3’. He can now guess the 2-spade. | .",

No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph. . On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes. . The Guru is allowed to speak once (let’s say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following: . “I can see someone who has blue eyes.” . Who leaves the island, and on what night? . There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn’t depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn’t involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.
