So you decide to give them a challenge. Suspecting that the thing they care about most is money, you give them $100 and tell them they are to divide this money observing the following rule: they are to discuss offers and counter-offers from each other and then take a vote. Majority vote wins. Sounds easy enough… now the question is, assuming each person is motivated to take the largest amount possible, what will the outcome be? . Note: careful… if the answer were that they split it 50% / 50% / 0%, or 1/3 / 1/3 / 1/3, it wouldn‘t be a riddle! . Note: careful… 96.6523544 % of people who send answers to this have not thought about it for even 1 minute. I guarantee you won‘t solve it in a minute. (96.6523544% of the time this guarantee is correct.) . Hover to show the answer. . I can not solve this one so far. If you can please share your answer! .",

            "content": "You are put into a room with a suitcase and a flask of poison. . The suitcase has been filled either with 1 million dollar or with worthless magazines. . The poison is bad enough that you would never drink it for free, but it will not kill you. You would definitely drink it for 1 million dollar. It is going to give you a few days of headaches and feeling very ill. . Wether the suitace contains money or magazines depends on a prediction that was made by a machine. . If the machine predicts that you will drink the poison, the suitcase will contain the money | If the machine predicts that you will not drink the poison, the suitcase will be full of magazines. | . From more than 10 000 past experiments, we know that the machine has 95% accuracy on both cases. . You are now in the room. The prediction has been made on you and the suitcase has been filled accordingly. . Do you drink the poison and open the suitcase ? Or do you open the suitcase right away ? . Note: This is taken from Mr Phi video serie where he discusses the NewComb Paradox . Hover to show the answer. . My understanding at this time (early 2021) is the following: As a human being, you can not make a plan and stick to it. This would mean inhibiting your rationality. This is something that, unfortunately, we can not do. . So even if you 100% plan to drink the poison, you will doubt that decision once you are in the room. . I think I am not able to stick to a plan of drinking the poison. Therefore, I think I would not drink the poison and go straight for the suitcase. . This is concluding that there is no way for me to win the money. . Someone that could inhibit his rationality and stick to a plan could win the money. Someone not thinking about it too much and going for the poison could win the money. But as soon as you think too much about it, you understand that there is no way you actually drink the poison once you are in the room. . To help explain it: . The extreme case of a transparent suitcase. In that case, everyone will have to answer that they don’t drink the poison. | The extreme case of someone that can turn off his rationality. That person will be able to stick to his plan of drinking and actually win the money. But this is not possible for a normal human being. Look for the “fatality of rationality” for this concept. | . | .",

If they already put the A switch to ON or if they enter en the A switch is ON, they simply switch the B switch, in whatever position. . The counter will be able to count the number of prisoner that have entered the room by counting the number of times he has to put the A switch to OFF. .",

The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom’s pharmacist and the kingdom’s treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one’s poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison. . The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a sneaky plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. . On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer’s plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies.

The treasurer’s plan was to drink a weak poison before going to the king’s challenge, and bring water to the challenge. In front of the king, he would drink the strong pharmacist’s poison, which would neutralize his, and then drink the water he brought. On the opposite, the pharmacist would drink water, followed by his own poison, and then die. . When the pharmacist realises that, he decides to also bring water. That way he drinks water both times, and the treasurer dies from his weak poison. .",

The conveyor belt is designed to [try to ?] exactly match the speed of the wheels, moving in the opposite direction. Can the plane take off? (different answers if you consider the words between brackets or not) . Hover to show the answer. . Yes. (Please don’t hit me). . If by speed of the wheels, we consider the speed of the the center of the wheels relative to the ground, then the answer is yes. The plane doesn’t use its wheel to take off. The motor thrust don’t care that the wheels are spinning or sliding or doing nothing. You have to realize that this is not like a car, the force is no pushing at the wheels, the force making the plane go forward is pushing where the motors are attached. So the wheels are just going to spin faster, and if the conveyor belt is long enough, the plane will take off. . Another way to see it is that the wheels are just there to keep the plane above the ground. They can spin at the speed they want, if the plane can move forward, it will take off. . Now, if by speed of the wheels, we consider the angular speed of the wheels then it gets complicated. This would basically be like saying “the conveyor belt does everything possible to make the plane not move”. . At that point, if the plane moves forward, the problem becomes mathematically impossible. When the plane is not moving, the angular speed is 0. When the plane moves, the angular speed is, let’s say, 10 ms/s. Now if the conveyor belt matches that speed, it will spin at 10m/s. But since the plane is still moving forward, this will make the wheels go at 20m/s (We consider here that the friction of the wheels is 0, they don’t affect the plane). So now the conveyor belt will have to match that speed. If the conveyor belt just tries to match the angular speed of the wheels, it will just go faster and faster up to infinity. If the friction of the wheels is 0, you could still argue in that situation that the plane will take off, with the wheel spinning infinitely fast in the opposite direction. . If the friction of the wheels is bigger than 0, you could argue that the threadmill manages to stop the plane. . If instead of the treadmill “trying to match” you have the treadmill “exactly matching” the speed of the wheels, than this becomes impossible. As soon as the plane starts going forward, this becomes an impossible situation because the treadmill has to match a speed that grows as it would try to match it. . Note that it doesn’t mean that the plane does not take off, but that the problem is mathematically impossible. . You can have a look at the excellent explanation from Randall Monroe on this problem here .",

If Bob passes, then the logician retires for the night asks and repeats asking the questions the next day. Both prisoners know the procedure of how the logician is asking questions. There are consequences to guessing. If either person guesses incorrectly, then they are both trapped forever. If either person guesses correctly, however, then they are both set free immediately.

She put the rest of the pack down on the table. Alice asked for my cards. She had a look at them. She gave four of them to Bob (he was across the table), and the fifth back to me. Bob looked at the four cards for a while. Then Bob looked at me, and named the card I was holding. He was right. I’m quite sure he couldn’t have seen it (we weren’t sitting by a mirror). . They did the trick again later to someone else. I watched for funny business. Alice didn’t say anything to Bob, so I don’t think they have a code. Also Alice is famously clumsy, so I doubt it was sleight of hand. . . Hover to show the answer. . When Alice had the five cards in hands, she needs to find a way to select one, and communicate which one she selected to Bob by showing Bob the four other cards. . Here is the way to do that: . In the five cards, there are always two of the same suite. | Alice is going to chose one of those two and tell which one to Bob using the 3 remaining cards. | The thing to notice is: when having two cards of the same suite, they are alway 6 cards appart in some direction. For example 7-heart and 9-heart are 2 apart. But queen-spade and 2-spade are 3 apart: queen-king-ace-2. | Now since there are 12 different cards per suite, two cards are always going to be maximum 6 steps away from each other. | So the way to do it is: from the two cards of the same suite, pick the one that allows reaching the other by adding up to 6 steps. So with 7-heart and 9-heart, pick 7-heart. With 2-spade and queen-spade, pick queen-spade. | Let’s continue in the case where Alice picked the queen-spade. | Alice gives back to Bob 3 cards + the queen-spade on top. And Bob has to guess 2-spade. | The goal is now to make the number ‘3’ with the 3 remaining random cards. That way Bob knows he has to add ‘3’ to the queen-spade, which will give him the 2-spade. | This is easily doable. With 3 cards you can make 6 combinations. Just assign each of them to a number. | Here is a way to do this: The 3 cards can always be ordered by value. So you can have card-1, card-2 and card-3. The six orders could be: [1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 3-1-2, 3-2-1]. Here we would select the order ‘2-1-3’ to represent the number 3. | So Bob sees the queen-spade, and then 3 cards that represent the number ‘3’. He can now guess the 2-spade. | .",
