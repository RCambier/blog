<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>When I learn about a new ML algorithm, the best way for me to understand it is to look at a very basic version written from scratch in Python. </p>
<p>This is a compilation of notebooks with very simple implementations of some ML algorithms. I try to only use numpy and scipy.</p>
<p>The goal is not to explain or teach. It's to capture the essence in a few simple lines of Python. If you find mistakes please mention it!</p>
