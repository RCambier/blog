    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>There are only two possible cases: either Anne is married, or she is not.</p>

    <p>If she is married, then a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne).
If she is not married, then a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George).</p>
