    <p>You also need 3 cats.</p>

    <p>If 3 cats take 3 minutes to catch 3 mouses, it means each cat takes 3 minutes to catch its own mouse. 
In 100 minutes, each of those cats will catch on average 33.333â€¦ mouses. So 3 cats are enough to catch 100 mouses in 100 minutes.</p>

    <p>Said differently, if 3 cats take 3 minutes to catch 3 mouses, these 3 cats catch 1 mouse/minute. 
At that rate, they will capture 100 mouses in 100 minutes.</p>
