    <p>A farmer has 100kg of potatoes. At the start, they are composed of 99% of water (the water is 99% of the total weight) and 1% of dry matter (the dry matter is 1% of the total weight). 
Later, during storage and because of evaporation, the water percentage drops to 98%. 
What is the total weight of the potatoes then?</p>

    <p>50kg.</p>

    <p>At the start, there are 99kg of water and 1kg of dry matter. 
Later, the quantity of dry matter didnâ€™t change, but it is now representing 2% of the total mass. 
If 1kg is 2%, then 100% is 50kg.</p>
