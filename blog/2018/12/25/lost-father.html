    <ul>
      <li>M = mother</li>
      <li>
        <p>C = child</p>
      </li>
      <li>M = C + 21</li>
      <li>
        <p>M + 6 = 5* (C + 6)</p>
      </li>
      <li>Solving gives C = -3/4</li>
      <li>-3/4 year means minus 9 months. If the child is -9 months, it means that the father is with the mother, in their bedâ€¦</li>
