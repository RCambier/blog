<p>Albert and Bernard just become friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May 15</li>
  <li>May 16</li>
  <li>May 19</li>
  <li>June 17</li>
  <li>June 18</li>
  <li>July 14</li>
  <li>July 16</li>
  <li>August 14</li>
  <li>August 15</li>
  <li>August 17</li>
</ul>

<p>Chely then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively.</p>

<p>Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too.</p>

<p>Bernard: At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now.</p>

<p>Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is.</p>

<p>So when is Cheryl’s birthday ?</p>

    <p>It is the July 16</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Albert (A) knows the month.</li>
      <li>Bernard (B) knows the day.</li>
      <li>If A knows the month and knows that B doesn’t know, it means that it is a month that only contains day that you can also find in other proposed months. Otherwise A wouldn’t be so sure that B doens’t know. So it cannot be May because if it was May 19, B would know. It cannot be June, because if it was June 18, B would know. It can be July or August.</li>
      <li>B says he now knows when the birthday is. B just deduced, like us, that it could be July or August because of what A just said. If he now knows when it is, it cannot be the 14. So it is the July 16, August 15 or August 17.</li>
      <li>A then says that he also now knows. So it has to be the July 16, since that is the only month where A has enough information to know the exact birthdate. If it was August, A would still need more information to differentiate between August 15 and August 17.</li>
    </ul>
